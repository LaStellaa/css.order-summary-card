## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap


### Continued development

I have just started using Bootstrap so i am trying to focus on customize the bootstrap frameworks to achive the desire output. I feel that my css is still quite cahotic but i am also starting to feel more familiar with all the positioning techniques. I am still struggling with the @media responsive section so i will look into taking a course specific on that.
